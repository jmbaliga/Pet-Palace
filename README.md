#Paul's Pet Palace
HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/PHP

This was an assignment for my Clientside Web Development class at MCC during Fall 2019.  (The professor's name is Paul.)  We were required to make a website for a ficticious pet store called Paul's Pet Palace.  For animals, we had to use dogs, cats, and birds.  (You could substitute reptiles for birds.)  The layout is my own.
